# Data available in the global wealth databook

Update: This is as of the 2016 databook. May be out of date.

There is a lot of data in the databook, but it is not immediately obvious what the data means.

:confused: This is data that the full meaning of is not clear.

:+1: This is data that is usable in the site. Primarily that means it is global, using estimation for countries with poor wealth data.

:partly_sunny: This is data that can only be used for the WENAO countries

:ok: This is data that is currently being used in the site/ingestion process.

## Section 1: Mostly metadata

Metadata info is ignored in this doc

### 1-4 Changes in asset prices and exchange rates rates 2015–2016, selected countries

### :confused: :partly_sunny: 1-5 Wealth shares for countries with wealth distribution data

## Section 2: Household wealth levels

Household wealth refers to all wealth not owned by government. This includes private enterprises which are owned by individuals.

### :ok: :+1: 2-1 Country specific wealth data summary

Some countries have a `-` for `Total wealth`. This is assumed to mean total wealth is rounded down to 0 billion.

### :ok: :+1: 2-2 Population data for countries

### :+1: 2-3 Adult population of countries

Currently using the overall population, not adult population for wealth per person stats.. does that make sense?

### :partly_sunny: 2-4 Wealth estimates for years 2000-2016

:+1: It does include regional and global totals (which seem to include all countries), however most of this can be derived from 2-1 data.

### :+1: 2-5 Components of wealth per adult in USD, by region and year

### :+1: 2-6 Components of wealth as percentage of gross wealth, by region and year

### :partly_sunny: 2-7 Changes in household wealth 2015–2016, selected countries

## Section 3: Global wealth distribution

### :partly_sunny: 3-1 Wealth pattern within countries

### :+1: Wealth pattern by region

### :partly_sunny: 3-3 Membership of top wealth groups for selected countries

### :ok: :+1: 3-4 Percentage membership of global wealth deciles and top percentiles by country of residence

:partly_sunny: Doesn't include all countries

:+1: Can get pretty close to global by using regional totals for non-WENAO countries.

### 3-5 Main gains and losses in global wealth distribution, adults (thousand), 2015–2016

Only some countries, but might be usable somehow.

### :partly_sunny: 3-6 High net worth individuals by country and region

:+1: Includes regional data

## Section 4: The poorest half of the world data

### :+1: 4-1 Share of adults (%) in lower half of global wealth distribution by region

### :+1: 4-2 Number of adults in lowest global wealth quintile, by country and region

Seems like this isn't excluding any countries

### :+1: 4-3 Share of adults (%) in global lower wealth tail, by region and country

### :+1: 4-4 Change in the share (%) of the bottom global wealth quintile, 2000-2016, by region and selected countries

### :confused: 4-5 Additional risk (%) of being in the bottom wealth quintile relative to a benchmark household, by household characteristics

### 4-6 Likelihood (%) of being in the bottom wealth quintile by household characteristics

Can't isoloate WENAO or non-WENAO so probably not very usable

### 4-7 Percentage composition of bottom wealth quintile by household characteristics

Can't isoloate WENAO or non-WENAO so probably not very usable

### 4-8 Household portfolio composition, Eurozone 2010 and United States 2013

## Section 5: Composition of wealth portfolios

Wealth composition is not relevant

## Section 6: Region and country focus

There are a bunch of graphs at the start of this, but they can't really be used because they don't contain the specific data.

### :partly_sunny: 6-1 Summary details for regions and selected countries

All this data may be contained elsewhere, so it might not make sense to use this.

### :partly_sunny: 6-2 Wealth per adult (in USD) at current and constant exchange rates, for regions and selected countries, 2000–2016

### :partly_sunny: 6-3 Total wealth (in USD trn) at current and constant exchange rates, for regions and selected countries, 2000–2016

### 6-4 Composition of wealth per adult for regions and selected countries

### :partly_sunny: 6-5 Wealth shares and minimum wealth of deciles and top percentiles for regions and selected countries

:+1: Includes regional stats

### :partly_sunny: 6-6 Distribution of wealth for regions and selected countries
